According to Dune queries, LR volume is ~60% of OS volume on a daily basis. Looking at top collections on OS vs LR, looks like that LR query is either wrong (not correctly filtering out wash trades that occur frequently on LR for royalty reasons) or the LR volume is concentrated in less popular collections on OS. Eyeball estimate of LR volume in popular OS collections is 10%.
