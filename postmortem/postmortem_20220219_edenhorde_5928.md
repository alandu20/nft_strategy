Perceived edge_ratio 4.8 but only 1 day of sales since reveal so really overfit the rarest trait (expression=weary). Several high sales with this same rarest trait, but they all had other valuable 1% or better traits. **Do not trade collections within a week of reveal, even if there are a lot of sales**.
