- 6 classes: pure, vyper, fenrir, yaksha, emp:real, nox
	- 1/6 pure: 1.P.U.R.E Paladins Unit: Renovated for Excellence Fudamentally, P.U.R.E is a division consisted of synthetically modified humans. Order, discipline, and teamwork are their core values. Equipped with high tech weapons and firearms, they will never hesitate to go through extreme overhaul or drug injections. Mission success always comes first for P.U.R.E.
	- 2/6 fenrir: Generated through a genetic recombination between humans and animals, FENRIR is a class consisted of SENSHIs that possess abilities derived from both species. Combats of FENRIR are driven by their basic instinct and intuition. They are capable of carrying out special missions through highly developed senses rather than the use of advanced weaponry. All individuals in FENRIR exhibit clearly distinct characteristics and a diverse range of skills.
	- 3/6 vyper: VyPER Violence yields Power, Earns Respect VyPER is a class consisted of synthetically modified humans just like P.U.R.E, but they prioritize individual freedom and pleasure over any rule or decree. Seemingly alike at first sight, VyPER and P.U.R.E exhibit extreme hostility to each other. Nothing can control the VyPERs as they are troublemakers, power and violence dictates the order within. Literally anything is justifiable if mission results and performances are proven satisfactory, even if it requires one to undergo agressive fights against your own team and slaughter each other.
	- 4/6 yaksha: YAKSHA SUPERNATURAL BEING: MALEVOLENT DEMON OR ABENEFICENT DEITY Members of YAKSHA are all mutant ONIs that are created and trained through supernatural ways. Every member has at least one or more horns and are capable of casting psychic abilities. Although their basic physical body specs exceed that of humans, only a small number of ONIs exist in the world. To hunt down a single ONI, at least 5 human SENSHIs must be deployed. Due to the limited number and exceptional powers they possess, ONIs tend to have much pride in themselves.
	- 5/6 emp:real: EMP:REAL is a class established to control and govern all SENSHIs. With at least one pair of wings on their back, they possess the capacity to shape the overall system and environment associated with SENSHIs. Some are born as angels with innate divine powers but some are also chosen long after genesis and granted angelic capabilities. Typically, their powers are proportional to the size and number of their wings, which also decides their rank within EMP:REAL as well.
	- 6/6 nox: In the beginning, the world was born out of darkness, where demons reigned supremeâ€¦ Demons reigned as gods of the world with transcendent power. Humans were afraid of the omnipotence of daemons and later locked them back in the abyss. But the initial fear begins again....
