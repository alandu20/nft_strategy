	- Bought right after selling 1124 in anticipation of further pumping (thought it would be like WoW), bought near all time high global floor

	- Perceived edge_ratio 4.8 but only 1 day of sales since reveal so really overfit the rarest trait (expression=weary). Several high sales with this same rarest trait, but they all had other valuable 1% or better traits. **Do not trade collections within a week of reveal, even if there are a lot of sales**
	- Also bought much higher than floor, in the top ~10% of highest sales. Consider adding "deeps" required edge component to exponentially increase edge requirement if much higher than floor. EDIT: 2022-03-14 added OTM fudge component to required edge to address this. [postmortem_20220219_edenhorde_5928.md](postmortem/postmortem_20220219_edenhorde_5928.md)

	- [postmortem_20220222_karafuru_4963.md](postmortem/postmortem_20220222_karafuru_4963.md) found required edge null value sorting bug causing edge_ratio instability

	- https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5caec438345aa6d86812c4ec03d2dd645cb5adc4b0d77eec3b6487091edc0047 sold edge_ratio ~-2 (below theo), around floor
	- Passed on mfers 4044 at edge_ratio ~2 about an hour earlier, which had same rarest trait and was successfully flipped for ~0.5 eth profit same day. Had 4:20 watch trait whereas 9004 did not have any watch, could be pricing issue. Floor started dropping next day
	- Max drawdown as of 2022-03-09 ~1.8 eth
	- Intentionally sold below theo. On 2022-02-25, 1 ETH = 2764 USD. On 2022-04-04, 1 ETH = 3450 USD. Clearly did not buy 9004 for enough edge, so took 3% hit in ETH space but USD is 25% higher (~2300 USD net profit). Also advantageous for this year's tax purposes to sell NFT and buy ETH at higher ETH level
- karafuru 4314: 2022-02-27 bought 3.777 eth, 2022-03-20 sold 2.6 eth, **net pnl -1.385 eth**, holding period 21 days

	- Bought near absolute peak of Hypebeast x Atmos Tokyo pump, one of the first undercutters during pump. Made mistake of trading super tight in anticipation of further pumping, under the constraint of having only 3.92 eth left in capital at the time. Another classic example of buy the news, sell the rumor. **Never panic buy into a news pump again, especially if it is post-news**
	- Afterwards changed --load_sales and --load_listed args to use dynamic files, needed to evaluate all latest listings quickly (w/o scraping again) not just those on OS activity page
	- Max drawdown as of 2022-03-07 ~1.7 eth

	- Realizing that it is an important part of the flipper strategy to require >4 edge ratios and sell within a day or two, even if at a loss. Approach up until now has been negatively selected, holding onto losers (e.g. mfers 9004) and cutting off winners. Need to require >4 edge ratios (especially in current low volume / bear market environment) b/c need to give up edge on sell leg to get a buyer to bite. In order to increase holding period, would need a sell signal too, e.g. market momentum on sales or listings
- rumble-kong-league 5283: 2022-03-10 bought 1.58 eth, 2020-03-11 sold 2.65 eth, **net pnl 0.87 eth**, holding period 1 day

	- Floor was 2.8 at time of buy. Afterwards changed ITM fudge logic to more reasonable edge_ratio of 3.8: [postmortem_20220316_karafuru_3724.md](postmortem/postmortem_20220316_karafuru_3724.md). Accepted weth bid soon after noticing original 2.6 seller's wallet was marked as potentially compromised on OS
- bossbeauties 4978: 2022-03-18 bought 2.1 eth
	- https://etherscan.io/tx/0x1330ffad15c944c5658285cfb94f780e2a64037d66c7f4ceef5c96e152836992 bought edge_ratio 3
	- Some subjectivity in this trade with global floor at 1.6 eth, lowest level since beginning of March alpha month. Gold medal trait traded ~5 eth at height of run earlier this year
- rumble-kong-league 6502: 2022-03-21 bought 1.5 eth, 2022-03-23 sold 1.89 weth, **net pnl 0.25 eth**, holding period 2 days

	- Decided to accept bid after someone mass listed ~15 kongs in various wallets all for 1.588 eth
- bossbeauties 6745: 2022-03-22 bought 2.1 weth
	- https://etherscan.io/tx/0xeebbe63eee2fd4c8ea07f06b6348fce1bad849fea73e082af79db30d595edce4 bought edge_ratio ~5, edge 0.70
	- Interestingly 0x0c5c81fcbf3d90eb8013bdf0696d306c8e4bb8a9 (GROWdnd) bought 2303 in the exact same block. 2303 was the only other vintage listed below [6.2, 100]. Either a really strange coincidence or wallet is running a very fast strategy
- bossbeauties 5844: 2022-03-23 bought 1.4 eth, 2022-03-25 sold 1.69 eth, **net pnl 0.16 eth**, holding period 2 days

	- https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0d691663b4858fe4cdfd623aaadddb244f4a3e75183954921271b8ba8ac9476d sold edge_ratio 0.17, edge 0.09
	- Orderbook (rounded to nearest 0.05) was [1.4, 1.55, 1.7, 1.75] at the time, with sizes [1, 1, 1, 4]. OS displayed floor was 1.55. Shortly after the 1.55 level expired or cancelled, so floor changed to 1.7. At 1.7 floor, the edge_ratio is ~3 and edge ~0.3 (theo 1.93 vs 1.75). Using new microprice logic (in-development), the synthetic global floor would be 1.66 (?)
	- Forgot to re-list the day before, probably could have sold a day earlier. Seems like edge_ratio 0.17 is too low, may need to change required_edge close to floor

	- Noticed after buying that wallet https://opensea.io/0x2e90606D7c5F13BbaBD54188c9c84f58Ab400570 (jtyler), holder of ~125 BBs, started listing en masse within last 12 hours or so. Has done so in waves over last couple months. Interestingly also occasionally buys, e.g. bought 5844 from me on 2022-03-25
	- Fixed required_edge trait parsing bug in this case affecting any BB trait with substring "crown": [postmortem_20220325_bossbeauties_866.md](postmortem/postmortem_20220325_bossbeauties_866.md)

	- Marked as suspicious by OS the following day, approximately 12 hours later. Could not sell even at 1.8 on LR. Submitted request to unfreeze on 2022-04-07, response on 2022-04-08 saying they will 2.5% OS fee they collected from the trade but have to settle separately with owner. Owner offered 0.3 eth return fee but could not pay until 3 days later, decided to get mods involved in general chat

	- Past comparable sales: 3.473 weth (1460: 197 total, 80 shooter), 3.45 eth (744: 205 total, 80 shooter), 5.5 eth (1708: 208 total, 83 shooter), 5.99 eth (7046: 196 total, 86 shooter), 6.85 eth (2109: 191 total, 87 shooter)
	- Pricing a bit suspect for lower overall, high shooter. Coefficient for shooting_is_pro < shooting_is_semi_pro not sensible. If pricing over last 120 days, edge ~0.72 and {stat}_is_pro vs {stat}_is_semi_pro relationships make sense. But r-squared is worse if additional overall stat > X condition added into {stat}_is_pro and {stat}_is_semi_pro logic
